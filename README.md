In this work, a data processing protocol based on mass defect analysis for the automatic construction of unique peak lists is developed addressing the need for the fast and efficient treatment of databases of mass spectra with limited mass resolution. The data processing protocol, implemented in MATLAB, is tested on a database of 126 mass spectra obtained from the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) analysis of the exhaust of a laboratory diesel miniCAST burner deposited on Ti substrates. The data processing protocol converts the mass spectra into a data matrix suitable for chemometrics (peak list) by combining mass defect analysis and multivariate analysis. In particular, the role of the mass defect analysis is expanded to improve the mass calibration and automate the creation of the peak list. In this context, mass defect analysis becomes an invaluable support for the efficient processing of databases of mass spectra with limited mass resolution by allowing the fast and automated construction of a peak list common to all mass spectra, by improving the mass calibration, and finally by reducing the number of molecular formulae consistent with a given accurate mass, thus facilitating the identification of unknown ions
